# rub-login

A small cli utility to authenticate within HIRN (hochschulinternes Rechnernetz) at Ruhr University Bochum that can also be used as a nixos module providing a systemd service.

Using rust for this is probably completly overkill, this is mostly just a small project for me to experiment with compiling rust in a nix flake.
